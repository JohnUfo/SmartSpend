# SmartSpend Learning System Documentation

## 🧠 Overview

The SmartSpend Learning System is an intelligent expense prediction engine that learns from user behavior to provide accurate suggestions for expense entry. This system reduces manual input time and improves data consistency by learning patterns from historical expense data. Version 2.2 introduces silent operation and enhanced performance optimizations.

## 🎯 Core Concept

The learning system operates on a simple but powerful principle: **frequency-based pattern recognition**. Instead of using complex machine learning algorithms, it employs a straightforward approach that tracks the most commonly used price-category combinations for each expense title.

## 📊 Data Structure

### LearnedPattern Model
```swift
struct LearnedPattern: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id = UUID()
    let title: String                           // Expense title (e.g., "Coffee")
    var combinations: [PriceCategoryCombination] // All price-category pairs
    var lastUsed: Date                          // Last time this pattern was accessed
    let keywords: [String]                      // Extracted keywords for better matching
}

struct PriceCategoryCombination: Codable, Equatable {
    let price: Double        // Exact price amount
    let category: ExpenseCategory // Associated category
    var frequency: Int       // How often this combination is used
}
```

### Example Data
```swift
// Pattern for "Coffee" expenses
LearnedPattern(
    title: "Coffee",
    combinations: [
        PriceCategoryCombination(price: 5.50, category: .food, frequency: 15),
        PriceCategoryCombination(price: 4.25, category: .food, frequency: 8),
        PriceCategoryCombination(price: 6.00, category: .food, frequency: 3)
    ],
    keywords: ["coffee", "cafe", "drink"]
)
```

## ⚡ How It Works

### 1. Pattern Learning Process

When a user adds a new expense:

```swift
func updateLearnedPatterns(for expense: Expense) {
    // Only rebuild patterns periodically for performance
    let shouldRebuild = learnedPatterns.isEmpty || expenses.count % 10 == 0
    
    if shouldRebuild {
        rebuildLearnedPatternsFromRecentExpenses()
    } else {
        // Quick update: just add to existing pattern or create new one
        quickUpdatePattern(for: expense)
    }
    
    saveData()
}
```

### 2. Smart Pattern Rebuilding

The system rebuilds patterns from recent expenses for optimal performance:

```swift
private func rebuildLearnedPatternsFromRecentExpenses() {
    // Get expenses from last 3 months
    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let threeMonthsAgo = calendar.date(byAdding: .month, value: -3, to: Date()) ?? Date()
    
    let recentExpenses = expenses.filter { expense in
        expense.date >= threeMonthsAgo
    }
    
    // Clear existing patterns and rebuild from recent expenses
    learnedPatterns.removeAll()
    
    // Group expenses by title (case-insensitive) and build patterns
    var expenseGroups: [String: [Expense]] = [:]
    
    for expense in recentExpenses {
        let normalizedTitle = expense.title.lowercased().trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
        expenseGroups[normalizedTitle, default: []].append(expense)
    }
    
    // Create patterns from grouped expenses
    for (_, expensesForTitle) in expenseGroups {
        guard !expensesForTitle.isEmpty else { continue }
        
        // Use the original case from the most recent expense
        let mostRecentExpense = expensesForTitle.max(by: { $0.date < $1.date }) ?? expensesForTitle.first!
        
        // Create new pattern with the first expense
        var pattern = LearnedPattern(
            title: mostRecentExpense.title,
            price: mostRecentExpense.amount,
            category: mostRecentExpense.category
        )
        
        // Add all other expenses to the pattern
        for expense in expensesForTitle.dropFirst() {
            pattern.addCombination(price: expense.amount, category: expense.category)
        }
        
        learnedPatterns.append(pattern)
    }
    
    // Also check for similar patterns that should be merged
    mergeSimilarPatterns()
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Suggestion Generation

When a user starts typing an expense title:

```swift
func getSmartSuggestions(for title: String) -> [LearnedPattern] {
    // Filter patterns by similarity score
    let similarPatterns = learnedPatterns
        .map { pattern in
            (pattern: pattern, similarity: pattern.similarityScore(with: title))
        }
        .filter { $0.similarity > 0.1 } // Lower threshold for more sensitive matching
        .sorted { $0.similarity > $1.similarity }
        .prefix(5)
        .map { $0.pattern }
    
    // If no similar patterns found, fall back to old method
    if similarPatterns.isEmpty {
        return learnedPatterns
            .filter { $0.title.lowercased().contains(title.lowercased()) || title.lowercased().contains($0.title.lowercased()) }
            .sorted { $0.totalFrequency > $1.totalFrequency }
            .prefix(3)
            .map { $0 }
    }
    
    return Array(similarPatterns)
}
```

### 4. Best Suggestion Selection

For each pattern, the system returns the most frequently used combination:

```swift
var mostCommonCombination: PriceCategoryCombination? {
    return combinations.max(by: { $0.frequency < $1.frequency })
}

var mostUsedPrice: Double {
    return mostCommonCombination?.price ?? 0.0
}

var mostUsedCategory: ExpenseCategory {
    return categoryFrequencies.max(by: { $0.frequency < $1.frequency })?.category ?? .food
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Silent Operation (v2.2 Enhancement)

The smart learning system now operates silently without verbose console logging:

```swift
// Before v2.2 - Verbose logging
print("🔄 Rebuilt patterns from last 3 months (\(expenses.count) total expenses)")
print("📊 Smart Learning Debug (Last 3 Months):")
print("   Total patterns: \(learnedPatterns.count)")
print("   Added expense: '\(expense.title)' - \(expense.category.rawValue) - \(expense.amount)")

// After v2.2 - Silent operation
// No console output during normal operation
// Clean user experience without debug clutter
```

### Performance Optimizations (v2.2 Enhancement)

1. **Periodic Rebuilding**: Patterns are rebuilt every 10 expenses instead of on every expense
2. **Quick Updates**: Simple pattern updates for individual expenses
3. **3-Month Window**: Only considers expenses from the last 3 months for relevance
4. **Similarity Matching**: Uses Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching
5. **Memory Management**: Efficient pattern storage and retrieval

### Auto-completion Logic

The suggestion system activates when:
1. User types 2 or more characters in the title field
2. System searches for matching patterns using similarity scoring
3. Returns up to 5 most relevant suggestions
4. Each suggestion shows the most frequent price-category combination

### Smart Suggest Button Activation

The "Smart Suggest" button becomes enabled only when:
- User has at least **3 months** of expense history
- User has recorded at least **100 expenses**
- This ensures meaningful and accurate suggestions

```swift
var canSuggestBudgets: Bool {
    let threeMonthsAgo = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .month, value: -3, to: Date()) ?? Date()
    let expensesInLast3Months = expenses.filter { $0.date >= threeMonthsAgo }
    
    return expenses.count >= 100 && !expensesInLast3Months.isEmpty
}
```

## 🎨 User Interface Integration

### Suggestion Display
```swift
struct EnhancedSuggestionView: View {
    let categorySuggestions: [(category: ExpenseCategory, confidence: Double)]
    let suggestedPrice: Double?
    let currency: Currency
    let onCategorySelect: (ExpenseCategory) -> Void
    let onPriceSelect: (Double) -> Void
    let onDismiss: () -> Void
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 12) {
            // Header
            suggestionHeader
            
            // Category Suggestions
            categorySection
            
            // Price Suggestion
            if let price = suggestedPrice {
                Divider()
                priceSection(price: price)
            }
            
            // Helper text
            if selectedCategory != nil || selectedPrice != nil {
                Divider()
                helperText
            }
        }
        .padding(12)
        .background(.thinMaterial, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12))
    }
}
```

### Auto-completion Trigger
```swift
TextField("Expense title", text: $title)
    .onChange(of: title) { _, newValue in
        if newValue.count >= 2 {
            updateSuggestions(for: newValue)
        } else {
            suggestions.removeAll()
        }
    }

private func updateSuggestions(for title: String) {
    // Get category predictions
    let categoryPreds = dataManager.getTopCategorySuggestions(for: title, limit: 3)
    
    // Get price suggestions from similar patterns
    let suggestions = dataManager.getCategoryFocusedSuggestions(for: title)
    let priceSuggestion = suggestions.first?.mostUsedPrice
    
    if !categoryPreds.isEmpty {
        categorySuggestions = categoryPreds
        suggestedPrice = priceSuggestion
        showingSuggestions = true
    } else {
        showingSuggestions = false
    }
}
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Patterns are stored in memory and persisted to UserDefaults
- Only active patterns (used in last 3 months) are kept in memory
- Automatic cleanup removes unused patterns to prevent memory bloat
- Periodic rebuilding prevents memory fragmentation

### Search Optimization
- Similarity-based matching for better user experience
- Fuzzy string matching using Levenshtein distance
- Limited result set (5 suggestions) for optimal performance
- Cached similarity scores for faster repeated searches

### Data Persistence
```swift
private func saveLearnedPatterns() {
    if let encoded = try? JSONEncoder().encode(learnedPatterns) {
        UserDefaults.standard.set(encoded, forKey: patternsKey)
    }
}
```

## 🔄 Learning Evolution

### Pattern Refinement
As users continue to use the app:
1. **Frequency Adjustment**: Popular combinations get higher frequency scores
2. **Pattern Pruning**: Rarely used combinations are eventually removed
3. **Recency Weighting**: Recently used patterns appear first in suggestions
4. **Category Consistency**: System learns user's category preferences for specific items
5. **Similarity Learning**: System improves pattern matching over time

### Adaptive Behavior
- **New User Experience**: System starts learning from first expense
- **Established User**: Rich suggestions based on historical data
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Patterns adapt to changing spending habits
- **Context Awareness**: Different suggestions for different spending amounts
- **Silent Operation**: Clean user experience without debug output

## 🛠️ Maintenance and Cleanup

### Automatic Cleanup
```swift
func cleanupOldPatterns() {
    let threeMonthsAgo = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .month, value: -3, to: Date()) ?? Date()
    
    learnedPatterns.removeAll { pattern in
        pattern.lastUsed < threeMonthsAgo
    }
    
    saveLearnedPatterns()
}
```

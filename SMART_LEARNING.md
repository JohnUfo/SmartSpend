# SmartSpend Learning System Documentation

## 🧠 Overview

The SmartSpend Learning System is an intelligent expense prediction engine that learns from user behavior to provide accurate suggestions for expense entry. This system reduces manual input time and improves data consistency by learning patterns from historical expense data.

## 🎯 Core Concept

The learning system operates on a simple but powerful principle: **frequency-based pattern recognition**. Instead of using complex machine learning algorithms, it employs a straightforward approach that tracks the most commonly used price-category combinations for each expense title.

## 📊 Data Structure

### LearnedPattern Model
```swift
struct LearnedPattern: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id = UUID()
    let title: String                           // Expense title (e.g., "Coffee")
    var combinations: [PriceCategoryCombination] // All price-category pairs
    var lastUsed: Date                          // Last time this pattern was accessed
}

struct PriceCategoryCombination: Codable, Equatable {
    let price: Double        // Exact price amount
    let category: ExpenseCategory // Associated category
    var frequency: Int       // How often this combination is used
}
```

### Example Data
```swift
// Pattern for "Coffee" expenses
LearnedPattern(
    title: "Coffee",
    combinations: [
        PriceCategoryCombination(price: 5.50, category: .food, frequency: 15),
        PriceCategoryCombination(price: 4.25, category: .food, frequency: 8),
        PriceCategoryCombination(price: 6.00, category: .food, frequency: 3)
    ]
)
```

## ⚡ How It Works

### 1. Pattern Learning Process

When a user adds a new expense:

```swift
func updateLearnedPatterns(for expense: Expense) {
    let title = expense.title.lowercased().trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    
    // Find existing pattern or create new one
    if let index = learnedPatterns.firstIndex(where: { $0.title.lowercased() == title }) {
        var pattern = learnedPatterns[index]
        
        // Look for existing price-category combination
        if let combIndex = pattern.combinations.firstIndex(where: { 
            $0.price == expense.amount && $0.category == expense.category 
        }) {
            // Increment frequency of existing combination
            pattern.combinations[combIndex].frequency += 1
        } else {
            // Add new combination
            pattern.combinations.append(
                PriceCategoryCombination(
                    price: expense.amount,
                    category: expense.category,
                    frequency: 1
                )
            )
        }
        
        pattern.lastUsed = Date()
        learnedPatterns[index] = pattern
    } else {
        // Create new pattern
        let newPattern = LearnedPattern(
            title: title,
            combinations: [PriceCategoryCombination(
                price: expense.amount,
                category: expense.category,
                frequency: 1
            )]
        )
        learnedPatterns.append(newPattern)
    }
}
```

### 2. Suggestion Generation

When a user starts typing an expense title:

```swift
func getSuggestions(for title: String) -> [LearnedPattern] {
    let searchTitle = title.lowercased().trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    
    return learnedPatterns.filter { pattern in
        pattern.title.lowercased().contains(searchTitle)
    }
    .sorted { pattern1, pattern2 in
        // Sort by most recent usage
        pattern1.lastUsed > pattern2.lastUsed
    }
    .prefix(5) // Limit to 5 suggestions
    .map { pattern in
        // Return pattern with most frequent combination first
        var sortedPattern = pattern
        sortedPattern.combinations.sort { $0.frequency > $1.frequency }
        return sortedPattern
    }
}
```

### 3. Best Suggestion Selection

For each pattern, the system returns the most frequently used combination:

```swift
var bestSuggestion: PriceCategoryCombination? {
    return combinations.max { $0.frequency < $1.frequency }
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Auto-completion Logic

The suggestion system activates when:
1. User types 2 or more characters in the title field
2. System searches for matching patterns (case-insensitive)
3. Returns up to 5 most relevant suggestions
4. Each suggestion shows the most frequent price-category combination

### Smart Suggest Button Activation

The "Smart Suggest" button becomes enabled only when:
- User has at least **3 months** of expense history
- User has recorded at least **100 expenses**
- This ensures meaningful and accurate suggestions

```swift
var canSuggestBudgets: Bool {
    let threeMonthsAgo = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .month, value: -3, to: Date()) ?? Date()
    let expensesInLast3Months = expenses.filter { $0.date >= threeMonthsAgo }
    
    return expenses.count >= 100 && !expensesInLast3Months.isEmpty
}
```

## 🎨 User Interface Integration

### Suggestion Display
```swift
struct SuggestionView: View {
    let pattern: LearnedPattern
    let currency: Currency
    let onUse: (Double, ExpenseCategory) -> Void
    
    var body: some View {
        if let bestCombination = pattern.combinations.max(by: { $0.frequency < $1.frequency }) {
            HStack {
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text(pattern.title.capitalized)
                        .font(.subheadline)
                        .fontWeight(.medium)
                    
                    HStack {
                        Text(CurrencyFormatter.format(bestCombination.price, currency: currency))
                        Text("•")
                        Text(bestCombination.category.rawValue)
                        Text("(\(bestCombination.frequency)x)")
                    }
                    .font(.caption)
                    .foregroundColor(.secondary)
                }
                
                Spacer()
                
                Button("Use") {
                    onUse(bestCombination.price, bestCombination.category)
                }
                .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
                .controlSize(.small)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Auto-completion Trigger
```swift
TextField("Expense title", text: $title)
    .onChange(of: title) { _, newValue in
        if newValue.count >= 2 {
            suggestions = dataManager.getSuggestions(for: newValue)
        } else {
            suggestions.removeAll()
        }
    }
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Patterns are stored in memory and persisted to UserDefaults
- Only active patterns (used in last 6 months) are kept in memory
- Automatic cleanup removes unused patterns to prevent memory bloat

### Search Optimization
- Case-insensitive string matching for better user experience
- Prefix-based search for real-time suggestions
- Limited result set (5 suggestions) for optimal performance

### Data Persistence
```swift
private func saveLearnedPatterns() {
    if let encoded = try? JSONEncoder().encode(learnedPatterns) {
        UserDefaults.standard.set(encoded, forKey: patternsKey)
    }
}
```

## 🔄 Learning Evolution

### Pattern Refinement
As users continue to use the app:
1. **Frequency Adjustment**: Popular combinations get higher frequency scores
2. **Pattern Pruning**: Rarely used combinations are eventually removed
3. **Recency Weighting**: Recently used patterns appear first in suggestions
4. **Category Consistency**: System learns user's category preferences for specific items

### Adaptive Behavior
- **New User Experience**: System starts learning from first expense
- **Established User**: Rich suggestions based on historical data
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Patterns adapt to changing spending habits
- **Context Awareness**: Different suggestions for different spending amounts

## 🛠️ Maintenance and Cleanup

### Automatic Cleanup
```swift
func cleanupOldPatterns() {
    let sixMonthsAgo = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .month, value: -6, to: Date()) ?? Date()
    
    learnedPatterns.removeAll { pattern in
        pattern.lastUsed < sixMonthsAgo
    }
    
    saveLearnedPatterns()
}
```

### Manual Reset
Users can reset learning data through:
1. Settings → Clear All Data (nuclear option)
2. Individual pattern removal (future feature)
3. Selective pattern editing (future feature)

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Users
- **Faster Data Entry**: Reduced typing and selection time
